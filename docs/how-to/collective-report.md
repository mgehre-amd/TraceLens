This topic shows how to analyze multi-GPU collective operations across ranks to
diagnose scaling issues, separating true communication time from
synchronization skew.

## Before you begin

Confirm you have the following before continuing.

- [TraceLens installed](../install/install.md).
- Per-rank PyTorch profiler traces from a distributed run (one trace per rank).

## Step 1: Generate the report

If your traces are in a single directory:

```bash
TraceLens_generate_multi_rank_collective_report_pytorch \
    --trace_dir /path/to/traces \
    --world_size 8
```

If the per-rank files follow a naming pattern, use `--trace_pattern` with a
single `*` placeholder for the rank:

```bash
TraceLens_generate_multi_rank_collective_report_pytorch \
    --trace_pattern "/path/to/trace_rank_*_step_3.json" \
    --world_size 8
```

For arbitrarily named files (for example, traces written by
`torch.profiler.tensorboard_trace_handler`, which are not named
`rank0_trace.json`), use `--trace_glob` with `--rank_regex` to extract the rank
from each filename:

```bash
TraceLens_generate_multi_rank_collective_report_pytorch \
    --trace_glob "/path/to/tensorboard/**/*.pt.trace.json.gz" \
    --rank_regex "rank\[(?P<rank>\d+)\]" \
    --world_size 16
```

`--rank_regex` must contain a named group `rank` (or a single capture group).

**Expected output**: An Excel report summarizing collective operations across
ranks, with aggregation metrics (`mean`, `median`, `min`, `max` by default). If
neither `--output_xlsx_path` nor `--output_csvs_dir` is given, the workbook is
written to `--trace_dir` (or the lowest common directory of the resolved
traces).

```{note}
Excel output requires `openpyxl`; TraceLens installs it automatically if it's
missing. Use `--output_csvs_dir` to write CSV files instead.
```

## Step 2: Read the report sheets

Each collective is assigned a `collective_id` (its Process Group name plus an
`index_in_group` reflecting its order in the trace); this is how the tool
correlates the same collective across ranks. The workbook contains a sheet per
collective type and analysis. The most useful:

| Sheet | Granularity | What it contains |
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| `nccl_summary_implicit_sync` | One row per (collective name, dtype, message size) | Aggregated latency, skew, and bandwidth (algorithm and bus) for collectives that incur implicit sync (AllReduce, AllGather, ReduceScatter, balanced AllToAll). |
| `nccl_summary_long` | One row per (collective name, dtype, message size) | Duration aggregates (sum/mean/std/min/max) and counts across all ranks. |
| `nccl_implicit_sync` | One row per collective | Per-collective implicit-sync breakdown; per-rank timestamps, durations, and `wait_time` are spread across `rank_<i>_*` columns. |
| `nccl_long` | One row per (collective, rank) | Per-event, per-rank NCCL records (timestamps, durations, stream, message sizes) for drilling into specific ops. |
| `nccl_summary_all2allv` / `nccl_all2allv` | Per (process group, dtype) / per (collective, rank) | All-to-all-v metrics (throughput, wall time, size imbalance, skew), aggregated and per-rank. |
| `nccl_all2allv_heatmap` | One row per rank, one column per rank | Per rank-pair send volumes (only with `--all2allv_heatmap`). |
| `straggler_summary` | One row per rank | Aggregated straggler metrics — see [Step 3: Find the straggler rank](#step-3-find-the-straggler-rank). |

Each sheet is produced only when the corresponding collective type is present in
the trace (for example, the all2allv sheets are skipped if the run has no
all-to-all-v). The detailed per-event sheets (`nccl_long`, `nccl_implicit_sync`,
`nccl_all2allv`) are controlled by `--detailed_analysis`, which is on by default.

### Interpret communication versus skew

The implicit-sync sheets separate the time spent in actual data movement from the
time a rank spends waiting for other ranks to arrive. The key metrics:

| Metric | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `comm_latency` | Communication time for the collective, taken as the *minimum duration across ranks* — this strips out per-rank waiting so it reflects real data movement. |
| `algo bw` | Algorithm bandwidth: message size / `comm_latency`. |
| `bus bw` | Bus bandwidth (link utilization). |
| `wait_time`, `skew in start time` | How much later some ranks arrive than the earliest rank — the synchronization cost. |

High skew points to load imbalance upstream rather than a slow network; high
`comm_latency` with low skew points to a bandwidth or topology limit.

### Interpret all-to-all-v collectives (MoE and expert parallel)

All-to-all-v sends a different amount of data per rank, so there's no single
message size and the ring/tree `algo bw` / `bus bw` formulas don't apply.
The all2allv sheets instead report:

| Metric | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `throughput (GB/s)` | Total data moved / wall-clock time. Compare against link bandwidth to gauge efficiency. |
| `wall_time` | End-to-end time from the first rank entering to the last finishing. |
| `size_imbalance` | Max rank's data ÷ mean. `1.0` = balanced; `>> 1.0` = some ranks carry disproportionate load (common when some MoE experts are hotter than others). |
| `max_rank_dur / min_rank_dur` | Spread in per-rank kernel time. A large spread together with high `size_imbalance` points to rebalancing expert routing or dropping tokens. |
| `skew in start time` | How far apart ranks enter the collective — large skew means some ranks are blocked by upstream compute. |

To diagnose low throughput, check `size_imbalance`:

- **`size_imbalance` ≈ 1.0:** all ranks are sending roughly equal amounts of
  data, so the slow throughput isn't caused by one rank doing more work than
  others. Look for software or driver overhead instead (launch latency, kernel
  scheduling).
- **`size_imbalance` >> 1.0:** some ranks are sending more data than
  others. This is common in Mixture-of-Experts models where certain experts
  attract more tokens. The busiest rank takes the longest, and all other ranks
  wait for it to finish before the collective can complete.

To see which specific rank pairs are exchanging the most data and identify the
overloaded rank, add `--all2allv_heatmap`.

## Step 3: Find the straggler rank

A straggler is the rank that consistently arrives last at collectives, forcing
the others to wait in implicit synchronization. Open the `straggler_summary`
sheet: it's sorted so the *straggler is the first row* (lowest total wait
time — it arrives last, so it rarely waits itself).

Example from an 8-rank Llama 70B FSDP run (`straggler_summary`, truncated):

| rank | total_wait_time_us | mean_wait_time_us | times_arrived_last | times_arrived_first | pct_arrived_last | num_collectives | total_nccl_dur_us |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------|---------------------|------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 4 | 27,195 | 55.7 | 420 | 6 | 86.1% | 488 | 3,910,753 |
| 5 | 4,660,353 | 9,549.9 | 39 | 10 | 8.0% | 488 | 8,463,896 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 0 | 13,358,753 | 27,374.5 | 3 | 320 | 0.6% | 488 | 17,203,432 |

Rank 4 is the straggler: the lowest total wait time, last to arrive 86% of the
time, and the lowest NCCL kernel duration (other ranks' durations are inflated
by the time they spend waiting for it).

| Column | What it tells you |
|--------|-------------------|
| `total_wait_time_us` | Sum of this rank's wait across all collectives. The straggler has the *lowest* value. |
| `times_arrived_last` / `pct_arrived_last` | How often this rank was last. The straggler dominates these. |
| `times_arrived_first` | How often this rank was first; the rank highest here pays the biggest sync penalty. |
| `total_nccl_dur_us` | Time inside NCCL kernels; the straggler is typically *lowest* (others are inflated by wait time). |

Once you know the straggler, merge its trace with a fast rank using
[trace fusion](./trace-fusion.md) and open the result in Perfetto to see what
compute or memory work delays the straggler before each collective.

## Command-line options

The following table describes all available options.

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--trace_dir` / `--trace_pattern` / `--trace_glob` | — | Mutually exclusive ways to locate the per-rank traces (directory, `*`-pattern, or glob). Exactly one is required. |
| `--world_size` | required | Number of ranks. |
| `--rank_regex` | `rank[\[\-_/]?(?P<rank>\d+)` | With `--trace_glob`, regex (named group `rank` or one capture group) used to extract the rank from each filename. |
| `--output_xlsx_path` | auto | Output Excel path. If omitted, written to the trace directory / lowest common directory of the traces. |
| `--output_csvs_dir` | None | Write each sheet as a separate CSV here instead of (or alongside) Excel. |
| `--detailed_analysis` | on | Emit the per-event detail sheets (`nccl_long`, `nccl_implicit_sync`, `nccl_all2allv`) in addition to the summaries. |
| `--agg_metrics` | `mean median min max` | Aggregation metrics in the summary sheets. |
| `--gpus_per_node` | auto | Adds `node_id` / `node_span` columns and labels each process group `intra_node` or `inter_node`. Auto-detected from trace `deviceProperties` if omitted. |
| `--all2allv_heatmap` | off | Add the `nccl_all2allv_heatmap` sheet (per rank-pair send volumes) — useful for spotting imbalanced all-to-all / MoE routing. |
| `--use_multiprocessing` | off | Load traces in parallel — a significant speedup when processing many large per-rank traces. |
| `--max_workers` | `os.cpu_count()` | Cap on worker processes (requires `--use_multiprocessing`). |

Example combining topology labeling, the heatmap, and parallel loading:

```bash
TraceLens_generate_multi_rank_collective_report_pytorch \
    --trace_dir /path/to/traces \
    --world_size 8 \
    --gpus_per_node 8 \
    --all2allv_heatmap \
    --use_multiprocessing
```
