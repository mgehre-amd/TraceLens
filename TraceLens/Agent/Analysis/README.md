# TraceLens Agent

The TraceLens Agent is an agentic performance analysis tool that generates actionable optimization recommendations for training and inference workloads. The system supports automated analysis of training and inference traces supported by TraceLens. Skills have been employed to define a structured workflow and interpret analysis results, combined with codified analysis to offer repeatability and reliability. The output is a single stakeholder-facing report (`analysis.md`) organized as a prioritized bottleneck list. Findings are ranked and grouped into three tiers (Compute Kernel Optimizations, Kernel Fusion Opportunities, and System-Level Optimizations), and each finding carries the supporting evidence, the reasoning behind the call-out and a possible concrete resolution.

## Analysis Modes

**Standalone**: Single-trace roofline analysis. Suitable when a single trace is available and the goal is to identify where performance falls short of hardware limits. Recommended default for performance analysis.

**Comparative**: Two-trace gap analysis. The agent compares a primary trace against a reference trace (e.g. a different platform, a tuned config) and identifies inefficiencies in the primary trace relative to the reference. Suitable when the goal is to understand where the primary trace is slower than the reference. Comparative analysis works best when both traces are collected from the same framework (e.g. both from vLLM, both from SGLang, or both from ATOM). Cross-framework comparisons may produce misleading gap estimates due to structural differences in operation call stacks.

### Supported Analyses

| | Standalone | Comparative |
|---|---|---|
| **Eager** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Graph + Capture** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Graph** | ❌ | ❌ |

---

## Prerequisites

### 1. Install TraceLens

**Local (no container):**

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/AMD-AGI/TraceLens.git
```

**Cluster with container:**

SSH into your node, exec into the container, and install.

Option 1: pip install

```bash
ssh <node>
docker exec -it <container> bash
pip install git+https://github.com/AMD-AGI/TraceLens.git
```

Option 2: pip install from source

```bash
ssh <node>
docker exec -it <container> bash
git clone https://github.com/AMD-AGI/TraceLens.git
cd TraceLens
pip install -e .
```

### 2. Collect a trace

The orchestrator runs against a single PyTorch profiler trace (`.json` or `.json.gz`). Collection is workload-specific:

- **Generic Eager Traces**: Instrument your loop with `torch.profiler.profile(...)`, enabling CPU-side call-stack and shape capture (`with_stack=True`, `record_shapes=True`). Profile a representative steady-state window (a handful of steps, post-warmup) and log the trace with `prof.export_chrome_trace(...)`. A single rank's trace is enough for per-rank analysis. The [PyTorch profiling walkthrough](../../../notebooks/torch-profiling.ipynb) walks through this end to end.
- **Inference Traces with Graph Capture**: Collection has framework-specific requirements. Follow guidelines in [Generate a PyTorch inference report](../../../docs/how-to/generate-perf-report-pytorch-inference.md). The [Profiling skill](../Profiling/README.md) automates vLLM/SGLang/ATOM benchmarking and PyTorch profiler trace collection via [Magpie](https://github.com/AMD-AGI/Magpie), producing analysis-ready traces. For graph-mode workloads you produce two artifacts: a graph-replay trace and a graph-capture folder. In inference mode with execution mode `graph replay + capture`, TraceLens merges call-stack and shape information from the capture folder into the replay tree before analysis.

### 3. Establish a hardware performance baseline

Roofline analysis compares each measured kernel against your GPU's max-achievable TFLOPS and HBM bandwidth, so the analysis needs a `<platform>.json` arch file for your hardware. Bundled arch files live in [`utils/arch/`](utils/arch/); if your platform is not already there (or you want stack-specific measured values instead of published specs), generate benchmark-derived peak TFLOPS and HBM with the GPU microbenchmarking suite. It measures matrix/vector TFLOPS and HBM bandwidth and writes the arch JSON in the exact shape the roofline expects. See the [Benchmarking README](../../PerfModel/benchmarking/README.md).

---

## Quick Start - How to Use

> **Note**: The orchestrator skills are portable and work with agentic runners that support skill-file discovery.

> **Skill paths in the package:** The orchestrator and its subagent prompts live under `TraceLens/Agent/Analysis/skills/analysis-orchestrator/` (`SKILL.md`, `reference.md`, and `agents/*.md`).

### To run manually:

1. **In an agent chat with a capable frontier model that has a context length of 1M, invoke one of:**
   - Standalone (single eager trace):
    ```
    "Follow the analysis orchestrator installed with TraceLens and run the full agentic analysis workflow on <path_to_trace.json>"
    ```
   - Standalone (single graph replay trace with capture trace directory):
    ```
    "Follow the analysis orchestrator installed with TraceLens and run the full agentic analysis workflow on <path_to_trace.json> with capture folder <path_to_capture_folder>"
    ```
   - Comparative (two eager traces):
    ```
    "Follow the analysis orchestrator installed with TraceLens and run the full agentic analysis workflow on <path_to_trace1.json> and <path_to_trace2.json>"
    ```
   - Comparative (two graph replay traces with capture trace directories):
    ```
    "Follow the analysis orchestrator installed with TraceLens and run the full agentic analysis workflow on <path_to_trace1.json> with capture folder <path_to_capture1.json> and <path_to_trace2.json> with capture folder <path_to_capture2.json>"
    ```
    **NOTE**: Always pass **baseline** trace as trace1


2. **Provide if prompted:**
   - Trace file path
   - Platform (of first trace)
   - Analysis mode: default (training and non-vLLM/SGLang/ATOM eager inference) vs inference (vLLM/SGLang/ATOM)
   - If inference: execution mode (eager or graph replay + capture) and capture folder path if applicable
   - Node name / container name / venv name
   - Output directory (optional)


3. **Results:**
   - **User-facing output**: `analysis.md` is the only artifact intended for end-user review - a stakeholder report with prioritized recommendations organized into three sections: Compute Kernel Optimizations, Kernel Fusion Opportunities (experimental), and System-Level Optimizations. The Detailed Analysis section mirrors this order with detailed Compute Kernel Insights, Kernel Fusion Insights and System-Level Insights.
   - **Agent internals** (agent intermediates; review not recommended): `system_findings/`, `category_findings/`, `category_data/`, `metadata/`, `perf_report_csvs/`, `perf_report.xlsx`. See [Output Files](#output-files) for the full layout.

### To run headless (non-interactive):

Any agentic CLI runner that supports skill-file discovery and headless (print/non-interactive) execution can drive the orchestrator without prompts. Consult your runner's docs for its command, its non-interactive/auto-approve flags, and its model-selection flag, then pass every parameter inline in the prompt:

```bash
<agent-cli> <headless-flags> --model <model> \
    "Follow the analysis orchestrator installed with the TraceLens pip package (look under TraceLens/Agent/Analysis/skills/analysis-orchestrator/ in the package installation directory) and run the full agentic analysis workflow on <path_to_trace.json> with platform <platform>, analysis mode <default|inference>, [execution mode <eager|graph replay + capture>, capture folder <path_to_capture_folder>,] node <node>, container <container>, output to <output_dir>"
```

Set `analysis mode inference` for vLLM/SGLang/ATOM traces (and include the `execution mode` / `capture folder` fields when using graph replay + capture); use `analysis mode default` for training and non-vLLM/SGLang eager inference. Passing all parameters inline avoids interactive prompts, which is useful for batch runs and CI pipelines (see `agent_evals/Analysis/eval_scripts/generate_ref.sh` for an example).

## Integrating with Model Optimization Flows

`analysis.md` is designed to be consumed by both readers and optimization systems to iteratively resolve bottlenecks (kernel tuning, kernel fusion, model codebase updates, etc.).

### Anatomy of `analysis.md`

Every report has the same top-level structure, in this order:

1. **Executive Summary**: Narrative one-paragraph workload characterization, a metrics table (Total Time, Compute %, Idle %, Exposed Communication %, Top Bottleneck Category), and an embedded performance-improvement chart.
2. **Compute Kernel Optimizations**: Top Operations table followed by per-category P-items (P1, P2, …) sorted by `impact_score` (Score highlighting the impact of an optimization). Each P-item has an summarizing Insight / Action / Impact triplet.
3. **Kernel Fusion Opportunities (Experimental)**: Kernel fusion candidates 
4. **System-Level Optimizations (Experimental)**: System-level P-items (idle, memcpy, compute/comm overlap)
5. **Detailed Analysis**: Per-P-item drill-down (`Compute Kernel Insights`, `Kernel Fusion Insights`, `System-Level Insights`) with identification rationale, data tables, and reasoning.

### Reference snippets

The snippets below are illustrative excerpts showing the format of the agent's analysis report in the standalone mode.

#### Compute Analysis

> <a id="detailed-analysis-compute-p1"></a>

> #### 🔴 P1: Compute-bound BF16 GEMMs underrunning roofline (Tensile)
>
> **Identification:** 18 BF16 `aten::mm` shapes were flagged as the dominant GEMM cluster in the trace, accounting for 45.7 s of GPU kernel time (~80.6% of compute time). All flagged operations dispatch through the **Tensile** backend with `bound_type = compute`. The cluster spans the large MLP shapes (M=24576, K=8192, N=28672), the gate/up shapes (N=10240), the QKV/output shapes (N=8192), and the LM-head shapes (N=128256). (source: `gemm_metrics.json` → `category_findings[0].members[]`, `operations[].library`, `operations[].efficiency.bound_type`)

> **Data:**

> | Operation | Args | Time (ms) | %E2E | Count | FLOPS/Byte | Efficiency | Bound |
> |-----------|------|-----------|------|-------|------------|------------|-------|
> | aten::mm | (24576,8192) × (8192,28672) bf16 | 7607.463 | 13.42 | 320 | 5059.76 | 68.74% of 708 TFLOPS | compute-bound |

> | aten::mm | (28672,24576) × (24576,8192) bf16 | 6313.337 | 11.13 | 320 | 5059.76 | 82.70% of 708 TFLOPS | compute-bound |

>
> **Reasoning for Slowdown:** Every flagged shape has very high arithmetic intensity (FLOPS/Byte 3510–5863), so each GEMM is correctly compute-bound against the BF16 matrix-FP roofline (708 TFLOPS) rather than HBM-bound. The achieved TFLOPS/s sit between 486.7 and 613.5, which is 68.7%–86.7% of peak — the heaviest shape (`(24576,8192) × (8192,28672)`, 7.6 s of kernel time, count = 320) lands at only 68.7%, and a second 6.6 s instance of the same shape only reaches 79.0%, indicating the same logical GEMM is hitting more than one Tensile kernel and at least one is sub-optimal.
>
> **Resolution:** Tile / wave-occupancy tuning targets the specific Tensile kernels selected for these shapes so the same FLOPs are issued under a better-utilized MFMA pipeline, raising achieved TFLOPS/s without changing the algorithm. Narrowing precision (BF16 → FP8/FP4 where the model tolerates it) doubles or quadruples the matrix roofline (708 → 1273 TFLOPS at FP8, higher at FP4), directly lowering the compute floor for these compute-bound shapes. Generate reproducers for the kernel team for the lowest-efficiency shapes (68.7%, 69.7%, 74.0%) so the Tensile selector can be revisited for those tile/M-N-K combinations.

### Programmatic Interface

Every report embeds HTML comment markers that a downstream system can leverage without parsing prose:

- `<!-- impact-begin kind=p_item category=<cat> low=<x> mid=<y> high=<z> -->` … `<!-- impact-end -->` wraps every P-item's Impact line. `mid` is the canonical `impact_score`. `<cat>` is the analyzer category (`gemm`, `sdpa_fwd`, `elementwise`, `norm_fwd`, etc.).
- `<!-- impact-begin kind=top_ops -->` … `<!-- impact-end -->` wraps the Top Operations table at the start of the Compute Kernel Optimizations section.
- Per-P-item anchors `#detailed-analysis-compute-pN`, `#detailed-analysis-fusion-PN`, and `#detailed-analysis-system-pN` link each summary card to its detailed reasoning section.

### Potential Consumption Loop

1. Run the orchestrator on a baseline trace (see [Quick Start](#quick-start---how-to-use)).
2. Study `analysis.md`, focusing on the `## Detailed Analysis` section. Within each tier subsection (`### Compute Kernel Insights`, `### Kernel Fusion Insights`, `### System-Level Insights`), follow the per-P-item anchors (`detailed-analysis-compute-pN`, `detailed-analysis-fusion-PN`, `detailed-analysis-system-pN`) and extract each P-item's Identification, Data, Reasoning, Resolution, and `impact-begin kind=detail_estimate` low/high bounds. The detailed cards carry the evidence and guidance an optimization agent needs to act on.
3. Use the prioritization (P-item ordering, `impact_score`) to drive your model optimization workflow.

## Architecture

### Analysis Overview

The analysis is split into three independent tiers that can be composed separately:

- **System-Level Optimizations** (Step 6): Issues that affect the GPU pipeline as a whole -- idle time, memcpy overhead, NCCL blocking, compute/comm overlap. These are not about individual kernel efficiency.
- **Kernel Fusion Opportunities** (Steps 4b + 6, Experimental): Identifies multi-kernel modules that could be fused and estimates savings.
- **Compute Kernel Optimizations** (Step 7): Per-category kernel analysis (GEMM, SDPA, elementwise, etc.) focused on individual operation efficiency.

Each tier writes to a separate findings directory and produces an independently composable report section.

```

### Orchestrator

The **Analysis Orchestrator** skill coordinates the entire analysis workflow.
It queries user inputs, runs TraceLens to pre-compute trace data, and invokes system-level and compute kernel sub-agents in parallel. Finally, it aggregates and validates findings, identifies the model, and generates a prioritized stakeholder report.

### Workflow Steps

```
0.   Query User Inputs (Comparison scope, Trace path(s), Platform(s), Analysis Mode, Environment Setup)
1.   Generate Performance Report (branches on analysis mode and comparison scope)
2-5. Prepare Category Data (GPU Util, Top Ops, Tree Data, Multi-Kernel Data, Category Filtering) + Fusion Candidate Extraction → category_data/fusion_candidates.json + kernel_fusion_metrics.json
6.   System-Level Analysis (CPU/Idle + Multi-Kernel + Kernel Fusion, PARALLEL) → system_findings/
7.   Compute Kernel Subagents (PARALLEL) → category_findings/
7.5. Aggregate per-category Compute Kernel findings → priority_data.json (globally ranked)
8.   Validate Subagent Outputs (time sanity, efficiency anomalies, coverage)
9.   Prepare Report Data + Model Identification (subagent) → metadata/model_info.json
10.  Generate Final Report (analysis.md): compose System-Level + Kernel Fusion + Compute Kernel sections
```

### Sub-Agents

**System-Level (Step 6):**

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `cpu-idle-analyzer` | Analyzes GPU idle time and CPU bottlenecks |
| `multi-kernel-analyzer` | Analyzes memcpy D2H/H2D patterns, NCCL blocking, compute/comm overlap |
| `kernel-fusion-analyzer` | Identifies multi-kernel fusion opportunities and estimates savings via roofline model |

**Compute Kernel (Step 7):**

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `gemm-analyzer` | Analyzes matrix multiplication operations (mm, bmm, addmm) |
| `sdpa-analyzer` | Analyzes scaled dot-product attention (Flash, Paged) |
| `elementwise-analyzer` | Analyzes elementwise operations |
| `reduce-analyzer` | Analyzes reduction operations |
| `triton-analyzer` | Analyzes Triton-compiled kernels |
| `moe-analyzer` | Analyzes Mixture-of-Experts fused operations |
| `norm-analyzer` | Analyzes normalization operations (BatchNorm, LayerNorm, GroupNorm, etc.) |
| `convolution-analyzer` | Analyzes convolution operations |
| `generic-op-analyzer` | Analyzes uncategorized operations or operations without dedicated sub-agent |

### Sub-agent model

The orchestrator and all 13 sub-agents run on a capable frontier reasoning model, declared in each agent file's front matter under `skills/analysis-orchestrator/agents/`. The full set: `cpu-idle-analyzer`, `multi-kernel-analyzer`, `kernel-fusion-analyzer`, `model-identification-agent`, `gemm-analyzer`, `sdpa-analyzer`, `elementwise-analyzer`, `reduce-analyzer`, `triton-analyzer`, `moe-analyzer`, `norm-analyzer`, `convolution-analyzer`, `generic-op-analyzer`.

### Supported Analysis Modes

The orchestrator supports two analysis modes, selected during Step 0:

| Mode | Script | Use Case |
|------|--------|----------|
| **Default (training and non-vLLM/SGLang/ATOM eager inference)** | `TraceLens_generate_perf_report_pytorch` | Training and non-vLLM/SGLang/ATOM eager inference traces |
| **Inference (vLLM/SGLang/ATOM)** | `TraceLens_generate_perf_report_pytorch_inference` | vLLM/SGLang/ATOM traces in eager mode or graph replay + capture mode |

For inference mode, the orchestrator also asks for the execution mode:
- **Eager mode** — only the trace file is needed
- **Graph replay + capture** — requires a capture folder path; the script automatically classifies graph capture traces and merges call-stack/shape information into the graph replay tree

### Execution Environments

The orchestrator supports three execution environments. During Step 0, you are asked whether you are running locally or on a cluster, and the orchestrator builds the appropriate command prefixes automatically.

| Environment | When to use | What happens |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Local** | TraceLens is installed on the local machine | Commands run directly (no SSH, no Docker) |
| **Local + venv** | TraceLens is installed in a virtual environment on the local machine | Commands are prefixed with `source <venv>/bin/activate` |
| **Cluster (no container)** | TraceLens is installed natively on a remote node | Commands are wrapped with `ssh <node>` |
| **Cluster + venv** | TraceLens is installed in a venv on a remote node | Commands are wrapped with `ssh <node> "source <venv>/bin/activate && ..."` |
| **Cluster + container** | TraceLens is installed inside a Docker container on a remote node | Commands are wrapped with `ssh <node> "docker exec <container> ..."` 

### Output Files
